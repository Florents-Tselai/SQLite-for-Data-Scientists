This project contains the Jupyter Notebooks and supporting files for _${COURSE TITLE}_ with ${INSTRUCTOR}. 

These notebooks can be run on the O'Reilly Learning Platform [here](https://learning.oreilly.com/jupyter-notebooks/~/${NOTEBOOK_FPID}).

It contains both the exercises (/notebooks), possibly the solutions (/solutions), as well as any data or files needed (/data). If you are familiar with docker, there is also a dockerfile included for your convenience.
