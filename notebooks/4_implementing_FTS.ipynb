    "### Virtual Tables in SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual table is an *object that is registered with an open SQLite database connection*. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of an SQL statement, the virtual table object looks like any other table or view. But behind the scenes, queries and updates on a virtual table invoke callback methods of the virtual table object instead of reading and writing on the database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The virtual table mechanism allows an application to **publish interfaces** that are accessible from SQL statements as if they were tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL statements can do almost anything to a virtual table that they can do to a real table, with the following exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* One cannot create a trigger on a virtual table.\n",
    "* One cannot create additional indices on a virtual table. (Virtual tables can have indices but that must be built into the virtual table implementation. Indices cannot be added separately using CREATE INDEX statements.)\n",
    "* One cannot run ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN commands against a virtual table.\n",
    "* Individual virtual table implementations might impose additional constraints. For example, some virtual implementations might provide read-only tables. Or some virtual table implementations might allow INSERT or DELETE but not UPDATE. Or some virtual table implementations might limit the kinds of UPDATEs that can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual table might represent an in-memory data structures. Or it might represent a view of data on disk that is not in the SQLite format. Or the application might compute the content of the virtual table on demand."

       "'Fun SQLite story, I had a project that needed to do reasonably large scale data processing (gigabytes of data) on a pretty bare boned machine in a pretty bare boned environment at a customer location. I had a fairly up-to-date perl install and notepad. For the process the data needed to look at any single element in the data and find elements similar to it. I thought long and hard about various complex data structures and caching bits to disk to make portions of the problem set fit into memory, and various ways of searching the data. It was okay if the process took a couple days to finish.<p>It suddenly hit me, I wonder if the sysadmins had installed DBD::SQLite...yes they had!<p>Why mess with all that crap if I could just use SQLite. Reasonably fast indexing, expressive searching tools, I could dump the data onto disk <i>and</i> use an in memory SQLite db at the same time, caching solved. It turned weeks of agonizing work (producing fragile code) and turned it into a quick 2 week coding romp. The project was a huge success and spread to a couple other departments.<p>One day they asked if I could advise a group to build a more \"formal\" implementation of the system as they were finding the results valuable. A half dozen developers and a year later they had succeeded in building a friendlier web interface running on a proper RDBMS (Oracle 10something) with some hadoop goodness running the processing stuff on 8 or 9 dedicated machines.<p>In the meantime, and largely because SQLite let me query into the data in more and more useful ways that I hadn\\'t foreseen, I had extended the original prototype significantly and it was outperforming their larger scale solution on a 3 year old, <i>very unimpressive</i>, desktop with the same install of perl and sqlite. On top of the raw calculations, it was also performing some automated results analysis and spitting out ready to present artifacts that could be stuck in your presentation tool of choice. Guess which ones the users actually used?<p>Soon I had a users group, regular monthly releases and was running a semi-regular training class on this cooky command line tool (since most users had never seen a command line). I\\'ve since finished that job up and moved on, and last I heard my little script using SQLite was in heavy use, the enterprise dev team was still struggling getting the performance of their solution up to the levels of my original script, and hadn\\'t even touched the enhancements yet.<p>SQLite was rock-iron solid the entire time. I had a few things I wished it could do, but I usually found a way to manage. I wasn\\'t using it for its feature, it existing <i>was</i> the feature. SQLite sprinkled magic on my one-off hack job and turned into a <i>thing</i> that people ended up using.'"

       "\"EDITED ONE LAST TIME  I PROMISE, I REALLY DO, THIS IS THE LAST TIME  TO ADD:<p>I think the reason that OP's join-based queries are slow is that there are no indexes over his junction table's foreign keys:<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE movies_people (\\n      movie_id INTEGER REFERENCES movie,\\n      person_id INTEGER REFERENCES person\\n    );\\n</code></pre>\\nThus when he wants the movies associated with person 160, the database must examine the entire junction:<p><pre><code>    EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM movies_for_people_junction WHERE person_id = 160;\\n\\n    Hash Join  (cost=282.37..10401.08 rows=97 width=33) (actual time=7.440..64.843 rows=9 loops=1)\\n      Hash Cond: (movie_person.movie_id = movie.id)\\n      -&#62;  Seq Scan on movie_person  (cost=0.00..10117.01 rows=97 width=8) (actual time=2.540..59.933 rows=9 loops=1)\\n            Filter: (person_id = 160)\\n      -&#62;  Hash  (cost=233.83..233.83 rows=3883 width=29) (actual time=4.884..4.884 rows=3883 loops=1)\\n            Buckets: 1024  Batches: 1  Memory Usage: 233kB\\n            -&#62;  Seq Scan on movie  (cost=0.00..233.83 rows=3883 width=29) (actual time=0.010..2.610 rows=3883 loops=1)\\n    Total runtime: 64.887 ms\\n</code></pre>\\nNote the sequential scan on movie_person that accounts for 2.5 to 60 seconds.  If there were an index on movie_person(person_id), this could be an index scan.<p>(EDITED TO ADD: I <i>totally</i> misread the timings in milliseconds for timings in seconds, so most of what I originally wrote is off by a factor of 1000. I'm leaving it here for entertainment value and because you might want to play with the data set in SQLite. But my point is still valid: a vanilla join is comparable in performance to the OP's bloom-filter method.)<p>I'm having a hard time believing that the straightforward join on a data set as small as the OP's sample is really going to take 65 seconds on PostgreSQL.  Maybe that's what EXPLAIN predicts (with spotty <***>stats</***>, I'd wager), but EXPLAIN is not a reliable way to measure performance. For this data, I'd expect real queries to perform much better.<p>EDITED TO ADD:  The OP's article shows the results for EXPLAIN ANALYZE, which ought to have performed the queries. So I'm not sure why the results are so slow.<p>Heck, even SQLite, when processing a superset of the data set on my 4-year-old computer, can do the OP's final query (and return additional ratings data) almost instantly:<p><pre><code>    $ time sqlite3 ratings.db '\\n        select *\\n        from\\n          users\\n          natural join ratings\\n          natural join movies\\n        where user_id = 160\\n      ' &#62; /dev/null\\n\\n    real    0m0.006s\\n    user    0m0.002s\\n    sys     0m0.004s\\n</code></pre>\\nIf you want to try some queries yourself, here you go:<p><pre><code>    $ wget http://www.grouplens.org/system/files/ml-1m.zip\\n    $ unzip ml-1m.zip\\n    $ cd m1-1m\\n    $ sqlite3 ratings.db &#60;&#60;EOF\\n\\n      CREATE TABLE movies (\\n          movie_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL\\n        , title TEXT NOT NULL\\n        , genres TEXT NOT NULL\\n      );\\n\\n      CREATE TABLE users (\\n          user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL\\n        , gender TEXT NOT NULL\\n        , age TEXT NOT NULL\\n        , occupation TEXT NOT NULL\\n        , zipcode TEXT NOT NULL\\n      );\\n\\n      CREATE TABLE ratings (\\n          user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id)\\n        , movie_id INTEGER REFERENCES movies(movie_id)\\n        , rating INTEGER NOT NULL\\n        , timestamp INTEGER NOT NULL\\n        , PRIMARY KEY (user_id, movie_id)\\n      );\\n\\n      .separator ::\\n      .import movies.dat movies\\n      .import users.dat users\\n      .import ratings.dat ratings\\n\\n    EOF\\n</code></pre>\\nFully enumerating the joined data takes under a second:<p><pre><code>    $ time sqlite3 ratings.db '\\n        select count(*)\\n        from\\n          users\\n          natural join ratings\\n          natural join movies\\n      ' \\n    1000209\\n\\n    real    0m0.953s\\n    user    0m0.925s\\n    sys     0m0.021s\\n</code></pre>\\nAnd even going so far as to <i>print</i> the joined data takes under six seconds:<p><pre><code>    $ time sqlite3 ratings.db '\\n        select *\\n        from\\n          users\\n          natural join ratings\\n          natural join movies\\n      ' &#62; /dev/null\\n\\n    real    0m5.586s\\n    user    0m5.497s\\n    sys     0m0.059s\\n</code></pre>\\nSometimes, the old stuff works better than we give it credit for.\""
